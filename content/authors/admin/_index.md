<br><br>

I am Ayush Maheshwari (‡§Ü‡§Ø‡•Å‡§∑ ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§π‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä), completed my PhD from <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in">CSE, IITB (India)</a> with <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh"> Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan </a>. I was funded by Ekal fellowship from <a href="www.ekal.org">Ekal foundation</a> during my PhD.
<!-- and <a href="https://www.ieor.iitb.ac.in/files/faculty/mhanawal/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Manjesh Kumar Hanawal</a> -->

My research interests lie in the area of Natural Language Processing, Graphs from machine learning perspective. I have worked on constrained neural machine translation and  semi- and un-supervised machine learning problems with data-programming.

I am a key member of neural machine translation project, <a href="https://udaanproject.org">UDAAN</a>, which helps publishers to quickly translate technical content in Indian languages. The project is open-source and used by several Indian government technical education agencies and official languages departments.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing and reading about Indian culture, Ram√°ya·πáa and Mah√°bh√°rat. <br/>
