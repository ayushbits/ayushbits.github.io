**Presented Two Papers at EMNLP 2022**

Attended the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) in Abu Dhabi, where I presented two research papers published in EMNLP 2022 Findings.

## Paper 1: Post-OCR Text Correction in Sanskrit

**Title:** "A Benchmark and Dataset for Post-OCR Text Correction in Sanskrit"

**Key Contributions:**
- Released multi-domain benchmark with 218K sentences (1.5M words) from 30 different books
- Covered diverse domains: astronomy, medicine, mathematics (texts up to 18 centuries old)
- Dataset spans Sanskrit's linguistic and stylistic diversity across 3 millennia
- Best model (Byt5+SLP1) achieved 23% improvement over OCR output
- Open-source dataset enabling digitization of 30 million extant Sanskrit manuscripts

**Impact:** Addressing the digital resource gap for Sanskrit, a classical language with massive manuscript collections.

## Paper 2: SPEAR Data Programming Library

**Title:** "SPEAR: Semi-supervised Data Programming in Python" (System Demonstration)

**Key Features:**
- Open-source Python library for programmatic data labeling
- Reduces manual annotation effort through weak supervision
- Implements cutting-edge approaches: Snorkel, ImplyLoss, Learning to Reweight
- Integrates semi-supervised learning for efficient training
- **100+ GitHub stars** and wide community adoption

**Impact:** Enabling practitioners to build training datasets efficiently without extensive manual labeling.

Both papers address critical challenges in making NLP more accessible and efficient for low-resource scenarios.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
