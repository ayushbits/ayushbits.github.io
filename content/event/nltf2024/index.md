**Workshop: Building Indian Language Foundation Models**

Presented at NASSCOM's National Leadership and Technology Forum (NLTF 2024), India's premier platform for technology and business leadership.

## Presentation Overview

Shared insights and technical approaches from building large-scale foundation models specifically designed for Indian languages, addressing the unique challenges of linguistic diversity in India.

## Key Topics Covered:

**1. Data Collection & Processing:**
- Large-scale multilingual data curation strategies
- Quality control for diverse Indian language data
- Handling code-mixing and transliteration challenges
- Building evaluation datasets for low-resource languages

**2. Model Architecture & Training:**
- Tokenizer design for morphologically rich Indian languages
- Training architecture for multilingual models
- Distributed training on large accelerator clusters
- Optimization techniques for efficient training

**3. Model Tuning & Deployment:**
- Instruction tuning approaches
- Preference training for alignment
- Deployment considerations for production systems
- Performance evaluation across language families

**4. Real-world Impact:**
- Applications in education, government services, and content creation
- Bridging the digital divide through vernacular AI
- Democratizing access to AI technology across India

## Context

This work was conducted while leading a team of 5 researchers building Indic large language models from scratch, combining technical innovation with practical deployment considerations for India's multilingual landscape.

The presentation contributed to NASSCOM's vision of positioning India as a global AI powerhouse.
