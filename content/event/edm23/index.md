title: Invited half-day tutorial at EDM, 14 July 2023

event: Educational Data Mining Conference
event_url: https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2023/tutorials/

location: Bengaluru, India
# address:
#   street: 450 Serra Mall
#   city: Stanford
#   region: CA
#   postcode: '94305'
#   country: United States

summary: Along with Prof. Ganesh Ramakishnan, I delivered a half-day invited tutorial on our machine translation work ðŸ˜‡ on the topic "Data Efficient Machine Learning for Educational Content Creation" held at IISC Bangalore.

abstract: 'Machine Learning has found several use cases in education applications. Specifically, Neural machine translation (NMT) systems (e.g., in educational applications) are socially significant with the potential to help make information accessible to a diverse set of users in multilingual societies. NMT systems have helped translating audio, video and textual content in vernacular languages aiding both students and teachers. However, translation of higher education/technical textbooks/courses necessitate MT systems to adhere to the lexicon of source and target domain.

In this tutorial, we provide insights from our translation ecosystem (https://udaanproject.org) that has helped in translating 100s of diploma and engineering books each in more than 11 Indian languages.'
