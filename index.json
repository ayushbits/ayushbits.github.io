However, it is still considered to be a low-resource language when it comes to available digital resources. In this work, we release a post-OCR text correction dataset containing around 218,000 sentences, with 1.5 million words, from 30 different books. Texts in Sanskrit are known to be diverse in terms of their linguistic and stylistic usage since Sanskrit was the `lingua francua’ for discourse in the Indian subcontinent for about 3 millennia. Keeping this in mind, we release a multi-domain dataset, from areas as diverse as astronomy, medicine and mathematics, with some of them as old as 18 centuries. Further, we release multiple strong baselines as benchmarks for the task, based on pre-trained Seq2Seq language models. We find that our best-performing model, consisting of byte level tokenization in conjunction with phonetic encoding (Byt5+SLP1), yields a 23% point increase over the OCR output in terms of word and character error rates. Moreover, we perform extensive experiments in evaluating these models on their performance and analyse common causes of mispredictions both at the graphemic and lexical levels.

In this work, we argue that by not using any labelled data, data programming based approaches can yield sub-optimal performances, particularly when the labelling functions are noisy. The first contribution of this work is an introduction of a framework, SPEAR which is a semi-supervised data programming paradigm that learns a joint model that effectively uses the rules/labelling func- tions along with semi-supervised loss functions on the feature space. Next, we also study SPEAR-SS which additionally does subset selection on top of the joint semi-supervised data programming objective and selects a set of examples that can be used as the labelled set by SPEAR . The goal of SPEAR-SS is to ensure that the labelled data can complement the labelling functions, thereby benefiting from both data-programming as well as appropriately selected data for human labelling. We demonstrate that by effectively combining semi-supervision, data-programming, and sub- set selection paradigms, we significantly out-perform the current state-of-the-art on seven publicly available datasets.

However, unlike most existing works in hierarchical multi-label classification, we do not assume that the label-hierarchy is known. Encouraged by the recent success of hyperbolic embeddings in capturing hierarchical relations, we propose to jointly learn the classifier parameters as well as the label embeddings. Such a joint learning is expected to provide a two-fold advantage: i) the classifier generalises better as it leverages the prior knowledge of existence of a hierarchy over the labels, and ii) in addition to the label co-occurrence information, the label-embedding may benefit from the manifold structure of the input datapoints, leading to embeddings that are more faithful to the label hierarchy. We propose a novel formulation for the joint learning and empirically evaluate its efficacy. The results show that the joint learning improves over the baseline that employs label co-occurrence based pre-trained hyperbolic embeddings. Moreover, the proposed classifiers achieve state-of-the-art generalization on standard benchmarks. We also present evaluation of the hyperbolic embeddings obtained by joint learning and show that they represent the hierarchy more accurately than the other alternatives.
